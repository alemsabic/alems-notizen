## Meine Notizen

  <span class="section-marker"></span>
  <mark class="hltr-magenta">"A remarkable aspect in this respect is that the large number of publications and the great diversity of subjects covered therein are not the product of utilizing a plurality of different theoretical approaches depending on the research topic in question."</mark>

  <mark class="hltr-purple">"In so doing, he placed great emphasis on conceptual and terminological consistency and, for this reason in particular, was receptive to theoretical developments in other academic disciplines such as philosophy, law, theology, biology, or cybernetics. Whereas his initial publication activities were more strongly focused on the fields of administrative and organizational studies, he turned to"</mark>

  <mark class="hltr-yellow">"At a remarkably early point in his career – namely in the 1950s, before Luhmann had any institutional affiliation with academia but was still employed as a senior civil servant in public administration (höherer Verwaltungsdienst)3 he was conscious of the fact that the notes he took from his readings at the time, primarily in political science, public administration, and philosophy, would not be collected for a limited publication project but for a far more extensive endeavour."</mark>

  <mark class="hltr-green">"Apart from Luhmann’s exceptional intellectual abilities, there can be no doubt that this specific filing technique, by which he systematically organized the results of his extensive readings across a broad range of disciplines, provided the foundation for his universal theory and vast number of publications."</mark>

  <span class="section-marker"></span>
  <mark class="hltr-red">"In organizing his research in this way, Luhmann adopted a system of organizing knowledge that had emerged in the wake of early modern scholarship along with the rapidly growing number of available publications since the sixteenth century and the practice of excerpting that followed.6 He went on to develop to perfection the potential for systematic knowledge production7 inherent in this filing technique by devising a very specific system of organization and referencing that is unique in the history of the card-based filing systems that have been used in the social sciences and humanities in recent times – those of Claude Lévi-St"</mark>
