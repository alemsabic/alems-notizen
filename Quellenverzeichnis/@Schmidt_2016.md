## Meine Notizen

<mark class="hltr-magenta">"A remarkable aspect in this respect is that the large number of publications and the great diversity of subjects covered therein are not the product of utilizing a plurality of different theoretical approaches depending on the research topic in question."</mark>
💭 **Note:** Das ist Pink - brauche ich Pink? Wohl kaum.


<mark class="hltr-purple">"In so doing, he placed great emphasis on conceptual and terminological consistency and, for this reason in particular, was receptive to theoretical developments in other academic disciplines such as philosophy, law, theology, biology, or cybernetics. Whereas his initial publication activities were more strongly focused on the fields of administrative and organizational studies, he turned to"</mark>
💭 **Note:** Das ist Purple

💭 **Note:** Das ist rot


<mark class="hltr-blue">"The true magnitude of the file becomes apparent only when opening the drawers: each drawer contains between 3,000 and 3,500 handwritten cards in A-6 format. As Luhmann sought to limit the size of the file so that he could work with it from his desk, he us"</mark>
