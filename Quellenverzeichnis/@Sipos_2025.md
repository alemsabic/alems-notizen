  <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Use the “Write In-Depth” feature to turn bullet points into full academic paragraphs. It’s a helpful way to overcome writer’s block and accelerate the drafting process with structured, formal text that can be refined as needed. While tools like Yomu can support faster writing, AI-generated content should always be critically reviewed and revised by the author.
