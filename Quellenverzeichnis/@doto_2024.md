## Highlights & Notes

<mark class="hltr-yellow">"The system presented in this book is intended to help you skillfully navigate and leverage Luhmann’s approach to using a zettelkasten in service of writing."</mark> (S. 12)
💭 **Note:** Dies ist ein Kommentar, mehr nicht.


<mark class="hltr-green">"The first loop shows fleeting and reference notes informing the creation of main notes. This process reinforces what we find interesting in the world, and what we end up capturing in future fleeting and reference notes. The second loop shows that a better understanding of the connections between our ideas leads to more engagement with our main notes, which reinforces what we find interesting in the world, and what we end up capturing in future fleeting and reference notes."</mark> (S. 13)
💭 **Note:** Auch das ist ein Kommentar - der zweite fürs grüne Unterstreichen.

💭 **Note:** Kommentar zum Bild - mal sehen, ob es übernommen wird.


<mark class="hltr-magenta">"Imagine writing a single paragraph stating what you believe about the most controversial, polarizing topic trending right now. This one paragraph will be your “grand statement.” It will be published. People will read it. They will have opinions. As you imagine this writing, do you notice yourself becoming more deliberate about your word choices? How does this deliberateness inform your thinking?"</mark> (S. 26)
